            Soham Private Hospital, a private health care hospital is located in the eastern part of
            Kitchener. The hospital facility is conveniently located along the Fairview Mall with easy access
            to all major routes for transportation. We are located within close proximity of the Waterloo
            International Airport and away from the hustle and bustle of hectic city locations.

            In November 2021, the hospital was borne from the growing need of the public to access quality
            health care at an affordable price. Over our 17 years of existence, we have embarked on numerous
            development projects to provide patients a full service health care option.
